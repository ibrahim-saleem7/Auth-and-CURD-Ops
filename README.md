Auth Handling and CURD Ops Handling 
Repository Name: 

Node.js MongoDB Authentication and CRUD Operations

Description:

This repository contains a Node.js application that demonstrates authentication functionality using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and MongoDB for user management. Additionally, it showcases basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on MongoDB documents.

Features:

User Authentication: Implement authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to securely manage user sessions.
User Management: Perform CRUD operations on user documents stored in a MongoDB database, including user registration, login, profile updates, and account deletion.
Secure Password Storage: Safely store user passwords by hashing and salting them before storing them in the database.
Middleware Integration: Utilize middleware functions to authenticate and authorize user requests, ensuring secure access to protected routes.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle and respond to various types of errors and exceptions.
Documentation: Provide clear and concise documentation outlining how to set up and run the application, as well as explanations of the code structure and implementation details.
Technologies Used:

Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB
Mongoose (MongoDB ORM)
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
bcrypt.js for password hashing
RESTful API design principles
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Configure environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connection URI, JWT secret key) as needed.
Run the application using npm start.
Access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.
